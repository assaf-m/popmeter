How Kevin Spacey fielded the kind of questions women get asked on the red carpet

One of the biggest hashtags of the 2015 Academy Awards show was #AskHerMore. The campaign, led by Reese Witherspoon, urged the media to ask actresses about their work, rather than just their dresses and hair.

The campaign seemed to work — to a certain extent. While talking to Witherspoon during the red carpet show, ABC interviewer Robin Roberts avoided the dress entirely, instead asking Witherspoon about her roles in “Wild” and “Gone Girl.” The internet wasn’t so classy, however: After the interview, Twitter exploded with a debate about Witherspoon’s wrinkly forehead.

The kind of questions that actresses often have to answer on the red carpet are pretty inane, but they sound even more so when asked to a man. At the Oscars last year, BuzzFeed asked Kevin Spacey about mani-pedis, hair and Spanx – the kind of red carpet questions that are usually reserved for women. His answers are hilarious.
