Acura's refresh of its RDX luxury two-row crossover for 2016 made its world debut today at the Chicago Auto Show and will go on sale this spring.

The key model for the brand -- its second-best seller after the bigger MDX crossover -- gets a new engine and more upscale touches inside and out. The update faces increasing competition in the hot market for compact luxury crossovers.

The new model gets Honda's new, more powerful 3.5-liter V-6 engine that generates 279 horsepower and 252 pound-feet of torque and has cylinder deactivation technology that can shut down cylinders when not needed. Honda says that provides a one mpg boost in fuel economy to 20 mpg in city driving and 29 on the highway with front-drive and 19/28 mpg with all-wheel drive.

The crossover has been restyled front and back and has new LED lights all around, including the headlights like its larger MDX sibling that was redesigned for 2014.

The new RDX also has more luxurious seats and adds a top-of-the-line 'RDX with Advance Package' with rain-sensing wipers, keyless remote start, parking sensors, cooled seats and more.

It also offers the full complement of advanced safety and driver-assist technologies.

The RDX had its best sales year to date in 2014, with nearly 45,000 of the luxury crossovers sold in the U.S., said Acura General Manager Mike Accavitti.

The RDX is built at Honda's East Liberty, Ohio, plant.
