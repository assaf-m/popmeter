Winter storm blasts Dallas-Fort Worth area with icy mix of sleet and freezing rain

An icy winter storm is slowing Monday to a halt across northern Texas as it scoots across the southern states.

Up to a tenth of an inch of freezing rain and two inches of sleet had coated the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area through 7 a.m. Temperatures in the 20s made it easy for ice to accrue across the region after more than six hours of wintry mix. Side roads and highways were turned white, not necessarily from snow snow but from the accumulation of ice.

Wintry mix began across northern Texas in the early morning hours on Monday, peaking in intensity around 7 a.m. central time. Given the early start of the cold mixed precipitation, highways were coated in ice by the time the morning commute would have gotten underway, though not many people were willing to brave the roads at that point.

The ice storm has caused the cancellation of over a thousand flights in and out of the Dallas area. At 9 a.m., 89 percent of all the canceled flights flying to somewhere in the U.S. were out of Dallas airports on Monday morning.

The storm was so potent on Monday morning that thunder and lightning were reported south of Dallas amid the freezing rain and sleet.

A winter storm warning remains in effect for the Dallas area until 6 p.m. central time. Freezing rain rates of 0.05 inches per hour were reported as of mid-morning, and the Storm Prediction Center issued a statement cautioning of heavy bursts of sleet and freezing rain through mid-afternoon.

Sleet and freezing drizzle will likely continue in through the afternoon in the Dallas metro area, before eventually coming to an end on Monday evening, but wintry mix remains in the forecast for the Dallas area through Wednesday morning. The winter storm will continue to deliver snow and wintry mix as it pushes across the Southeast over the next 36 hours.
