How much for a Manhattan?

My spouse and I enjoy a good Manhattan as much as the next cocktail swiller. When charged $12.50 at an Arlington restaurant, we questioned that price as excessive. The server claimed it was the “superior ingredients.” Nope. Another place we favor uses the same whiskey (our requested Crown Royal) and charges a mere $4.50 for the same drink (same size, too, if not bigger). So, what gives?

But $22 for a cocktail? Harumpph! What the ­Feb. 18 Food article “Gulp. How’d we get to the $22 cocktail?” tells me is that our whacked-out economy has far too many people who make far too much money. There are also far too many of our fellow Americans for whom even our $4.50 bargain Manhattan would be out of reach. I guess we’re living in the Gilded Age redux.
